# Description
For the second exploitation, I investigated the PsExec vulnerability (CVE-2004-2730), which takes advantage of the way PsExec handles shares, allowing for remote code execution with administrative privileges.

## Step 1: Launching and Configuring PsExec Options

I loaded the PsExec module in Metasploit using the command 'use exploit/windows/smb/psexec'. This command instructs Metasploit to use the PsExec module, which exploits the SMB protocol to execute commands remotely with administrative credentials.

- To set up the PsExec exploit, I configured the necessary parameters in Metasploit, including RHOST 192.168.183.130 (the target IP address), LPORT 445 (the listening port), SMBUser (the username), and SMBPass (the password). These configurations ensure that the exploit has the right information to authenticate and execute the payload on the target.

- With all parameters configured, I ran the 'exploit' command to initiate the PsExec attack. The exploit successfully connected to the target and authenticated with the provided credentials, granting administrative access.

## Step 2: Covering Tracks

To minimize detection, I cleared event logs on the target system using the 'clearev' command in Meterpreter. This step ensures that logs showing the connection and activities are removed, making it more difficult for system administrators to trace the attack.

# Recommendations to Enhance Security

To prevent similar exploits in the future, it is recommended to:
- Disable SMBv1 and apply patches.
- Implement strong password policies.
- Regularly monitor and audit event logs.
- Employ an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect suspicious activity.
